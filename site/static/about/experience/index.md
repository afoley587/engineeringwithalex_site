# Experience

## How I Went From Mech-E to Software-E
If you can believe it, I was classically trained as a mechanical engineer.
I graduated from Drexel University in 2019 with a Bachelor's Degree 
in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science.  

About three years in to my degree, I had a realization. Well, two realizations.

1. I don't know if I really love mechanical engineering
2. It it **WAY** to late to change my major to computer science

I came to this realization while working for ASRC Federal. I was hired as
a Mission Operation Support Team Co-Op (MOST Co-Op). That fancy
title had a broad range of activities. On a daily basis I would:

* Manage simulations of the GOES Series of satelites so the Systems Engineers could validate requirements
* Maintain any electrical hardware that supported the aforementioned simulations
* **Write software to make engineers live's better**

Note - the last one is in bold for a reason. It completely changed my life.
My first python project was born! It was nothing special, but I was hooked on
software engineering. I immediately went online and bought "C++ For Dummies", 
"Python In Easy Steps", and about ten other books about writing code.

When I left that position at the end of my co-op, I knew that my career would
stray away from mechanical and go towards software.
