      I <i><b>LOVE</b></i> to hike. Over the past few years
      I have been fortunate enough to hike in the following places
    </p> 
      <ul>
        <li> Yosemite</li>
        <li> Tahoe</li>
        <li> Mount Ranier National Park </li>
        <li> Among more! </li>
      </ul>
    <p>
      I never do get tired of seeing the beauty that mother nature
      produced for us!

      I also very much enjoy surfing. Although I cannot say that I am the 
      most proficient surfer, it is definitel a favorite pasttime of mine.
      <br>
      In the picture to the left, I was actually trying to surf during
      an active hurricane (or the oprtion of it that hit NJ)

## Coding

      In my more quiet downtime, you can frequently find me sitting on my
      laptop working on some project. I have interests in just about every
      aspect of software, but some areas that especially peak my interest 
      are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Automation </li>
      <li> Machine Learning </li>
      <li> Image Processing </li>
      <li> REST APIs </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Most of my professional experience in writing software is in Java, 
      python, and C++ while most of my automation experience is done
      with terraform and ansible.

      I have a ton of hobbies and overall, am a pretty active person.
      I always enjoy getting out of my comfort zone and doing something
      that I haven't done before.
      <br>
      Would you believe that before I went skydiving, I wa terrified of
      heights? I thought to myself "What better way to get over that
      fear than to jump out of a plane?"
      <br>
      To me, life is all about experiences! So I try to have as many
      of them as possible.
